Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between
classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are
involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming
languages, some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in
support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns
are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.
